# :v: Rock Paper Scissors

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/xanderbylo/rock-paper-scissors) 

This is a rock paper scissors game I created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It prompts the player to enter either rock, paper or scissors and then compares that to the computers answer. It then declares a winner. The game plays for 5 rounds and keeps score.
